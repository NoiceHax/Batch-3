  The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
  sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in
  shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
  herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military,
  companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs
  became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been
  a topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the
  sobriquet of "man's best friend".
